# CustomMikraotGedolot
With our app, based on Sefaria's Yam Shel Torah, you can now create your own Mikraot Gedolot!
You choose the book from Tanach, and then you can choose any one of Sefaria's translations on that book, 
and up to 9 commentaries on the book. The PDF that the app then creates is downloadable and printable, 
and it's just like the best of today's modern Mikraot Gedolot.
Readable print, and the commentaries on a pasuk stay on the page, so no flipping back and forth!
Our app is great for anyone who wants to utilize Sefaria and likes learning in the Mikraot Gedolot format. 
It could be great for teachers who want to prepare sefarim for their students with only specific commentaries. 
We think our app can really help us all learn Torah. 

This project was submitted to Sefaria's summer contest 2020 תש"פ
